                <p class="legalBoldItalic">PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS AND INCLUDES WAIVER OF A TRIAL BY JURY IN A COURT AND OF THE ABILITY TO BRING ANY CLAIM ON BEHALF OF OTHERS.</p>
                <p class="legalBold">Overview</p>
                <p class="legalCopy">This Section 14 &#040;i.e., the &#034;Agreement to Arbitrate&#034;&#041; applies to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law. If the laws of your jurisdiction prohibit the application of provisions of this Section 14 notwithstanding Section 15 below, those prohibited provisions will not apply to you. IF YOU LIVE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, NONE OF THIS SECTION 14 APPLIES TO YOU.</p>
                <p class="legalCopy">In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination or breach thereof, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. Most user concerns can be resolved by contacting our customer support team at <a href="mailto:support@qalang.com">support@qalang.com</a>. In the unlikely event that we are unable to resolve your concerns and a dispute remains, this Section explains how you and we agree to resolve it. As explained in more detail below, <span class="legalItalic">we each agree to resolve any dispute between us through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</span></p>
            
                <p class="legalBold">Agreement to Arbitrate; Exceptions</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">If we cannot resolve our dispute through customer support, <span class="legalBold">YOU AND WE AGREE TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES AND CLAIMS BETWEEN US IN INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION, INCLUDING CLAIMS CONCERNING ANY ASPECT OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN US, YOUR DECISION TO DOWNLOAD THE GAME, YOUR USE OF THE GAME, ANY USER CONTENT, OR YOUR ACCOUNT. </span>This Agreement to Arbitrate is intended to be interpreted broadly, and applies to all legal claims under any legal theory &#040;whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory&#041;, and applies to any disputes or claims that you assert or that arise even after you stop using or delete your account for the Game, stop using the Game, or delete the Game application from your mobile device. This Agreement to Arbitrate also applies to any claims that are currently the subject of a purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class. You and we agree that the arbitrator shall have the exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of the terms or formation of this contract, including whether any dispute between us is subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate &#040;i.e., the arbitrator will decide the arbitrability of any dispute&#041; and whether all or any part of these terms are void or voidable.</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">An arbitration is a proceeding before a neutral arbitrator, instead of before a judge or jury. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court, and provides more limited discovery. It follows different rules than court proceedings, and is subject to very limited review by courts. The arbitrator will issue a written decision and provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party. <span class="legalBold">YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND WE ARE GIVING UP THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND THE RIGHT TO HAVE A TRIAL BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY.</span></p>
                <p class="legalcopy">This Section 14, however, <span class="legalUnderline">does not apply</span> to the following types of claims or disputes, which you or we may bring in court in accordance with Section 15 below:</p>
                <p class="legalcopy"><span class="legalBold">&#040;1&#041;</span> claims of infringement or other misuse of intellectual property rights, including such claims seeking injunctive relief; and</p>
                <p class="legalcopy"><span class="legalBold">&#040;2&#041;</span> claims for preliminary injunctive relief for violations of sections 4 and 6 herein.</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">This Section does not prevent you from bringing your dispute to the attention of any federal, state, or local government agencies that can, if the law allows, seek relief from us for you. Also, any of us can bring a claim in small claims court either in Santa Clara County, California or the county where you live, or some other place we both agree on, if such claims meets all the requirements to be brought in that court.</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">The Federal Arbitration Act applies to this Section 14. The arbitration will be governed by the Consumer Arbitration Rules &#040;the &#034;Rules&#034;&#041; of the American Arbitration Association &#040;&#034;AAA&#034;&#041; &#040;including Rule 1&#040;g&#041; of those Rules that provides for arbitration through the submission of documents only/desk arbitration where no disclosed claims or counterclaims exceed $25,000&#041;, as modified by these Terms of Use, The Rules are available at www.adr.org. The arbitrator will be bound by these Terms of Use.</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">To start an arbitration proceeding, use the form on AAA’s website &#040;www.adr.org&#041; or call the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">Any arbitration under this section that is required to take place in person will take place pursuant to the Rules, which provide that face-to- face proceedings be conducted at a location which is reasonably convenient to both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances.</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">If your claim is for US$25,000 or less, we agree to reimburse your filing fee promptly upon being notified of the filing, or pay it for you if you are unable to pay it and we receive a written request from you. Also, if your claim is for US$25,000 or less, we agree to reimburse your share of the arbitration costs, including your share of arbitrator compensation, at the conclusion of the proceeding, unless the arbitrator determines your claims are frivolous or your costs are unreasonable as determined by the arbitrator. If you seek more than US$25,000, the arbitration costs, including arbitrator compensation, will be split between you and us according to the Rules. Irrespective of the amount you seek, neither party shall be entitled to have their attorneys’ fees or costs paid by the other party, provided, however, that either party may seek to recover their attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration if the arbitrator determines that the other party's claims are frivolous or the other party's costs are unreasonable.</p>
                
                <p class="legalBold">For EU Users</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">In the event of any controversy or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms, including any question regarding its existence, validity, termination or breach thereof, the parties hereto shall consult and negotiate with each other and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a satisfactory solution. If they do not reach settlement within a period of 60 days, then, upon notice by any party to the other&#040;s&#041;, any unresolved controversy or claim shall be settled by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution &#040;&#034;ICDR&#034;&#041; in accordance with the provisions of its International Arbitration Rules. The place of arbitration shall be in London, England. The number of arbitrators shall be one. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English.

                <p class="legalBold">Class Action Waiver</p>
                <p class="legalcopy">For disputes arising between Qalang and you, or any other user, that are subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, you and we agree that we can only bring a claim against each other on an individual basis. <span class="legalBold">NEITHER YOU NOR WE CAN BRING A CLAIM AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. THE ARBITRATOR CANNOT COMBINE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIM INTO A SINGLE CASE, AND CANNOT PRESIDE OVER ANY CONSOLIDATED, CLASS, OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATION PROCEEDING, UNLESS WE BOTH AGREE OTHERWISE IN WRITING. THE ARBITRATOR’S DECISION OR AWARD IN ONE PERSON’S CASE CAN ONLY AFFECT THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT THE CLAIM, NOT OTHER USERS OF THE GAME, AND CANNOT BE USED TO DECIDE DISPUTES WITH OTHERS.</span></p>
                <p class="legalcopy">If a court decides that this &#034;Class Action Waiver&#034; subsection is not enforceable or is invalid, then Section 14 shall cease to have effect, however, the remaining portions of the Terms and Conditions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
