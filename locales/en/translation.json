	"paragraph_01" : "A long time ago there was a man that was very, very tall and strong. The Tayal people called him Halus. Such a man could be of great service to his tribe, but Halus was not that type of giant."
	"paragraph_02" : "The other young men learned to set traps for wild boars. The young women grew millet and sweet potato. But Halus had found an easier way to fill his stomach. He would rest his chin on the ground and pound his fist on forest floor, sending the animals running into his mouth. He chewed the ancient cedars of the forest as if they were sugar cane and tore out wide swaths of beeches to make into his pillow."
	"paragraph_03" : "He grew fat, his appetite endless. Meanwhile the members of tribe grew thinner by the day. The children’s stomachs bulged from starvation and the forests were stripped bare."
	"paragraph_04" : "The tribe had had enough. One day they called Halus, telling him there was a beast too monstrous for them to fell, that they needed his help, that they could share the meat."
	"paragraph_05" : "The women had built a fire underneath an enormous stone. When it was glowing hot they set it rolling down the hill. The men ran in terror from the supposed beast, while Halus waited at the bottom of the mountain, his greedy mouth gaping wide. Before he realized he had been tricked, he had already swallowed the fiery stone. He writhed in pain, holding his burning stomach, and soon lay still."
