	<p>Hey there!<br><br>We showed you our game Halus at Wizard World Sacramento last June, and we promised to let you know when our game was released on iOS.<br><br>And now the wait is over! In the meantime, we changed the name from Halus to Hotstone (it's easier to remember).<br><br>Hotstone has been released on iOS! You may now get your iPhone or iPad copy from the App Store. We have spent the last three years crafting and polishing it, and we are sure that you will love it! The first 19 levels are free to play, and you can even view the first page of our comic inside the game. Enjoy!</p>

	Thanks for your support,<br><br>Team Qalang
